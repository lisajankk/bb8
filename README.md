# BB-8 Inspired Mobile Robot Project
This project was developed as part of the coursework for the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. The project was carried out by a team of six individuals.

### Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to plan and construct a mobile robot inspired by the BB-8 model. The project work is divided into several stages, including:

1. Designing the body and head of the robot.
2. Selecting the necessary electronic components.
3. Designing the circuit connections.
4. Writing the robot's control program.
5. Testing and evaluating the robot's actions.

### Features
The resulting robot project operates as intended, serving as a **mobile robot controlled through a dedicated application**. In addition to basic mobility, the robot incorporates the following features:

* **Head Stabilization**: The robot can maintain its head at the top of the construction.
* **Sound Emission**: It is capable of emitting sounds.
* **Color Recognition**: The robot can recognize colors.

### Documentation
For more detailed information and technical specifications, please refer to the documentation provided in PDF format. The documentation contains in-depth explanations, diagrams, and code examples to help you better understand and utilize the project.
